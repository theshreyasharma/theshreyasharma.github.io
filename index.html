                    I'm a sophomore at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu" target="_blank">Computer Science</a>. 
                    I'm an aspiring software engineer interested in education as well as the use of technology 
                    to improve the way people go about their lives.
                    I've created this page to document my development as a student and as a person.

                <p id="intro">
                    This fall, I have been working as a <strong style="color:darkcyan;">Course Associate</strong> for the fully online <a href="https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu" target="_blank">CS 125</a>.
                    I host content review sessions twice a week while also holding office hours and managing Course Assistants. I have also continued 
                    as a <strong style="color:darkcyan;">Project Manager</strong> for <a href="http://cs196.cs.illinois.edu" target="_blank">CS 196</a>.
                    This semester, I am in charge of multiple teams, both of which are focused on analyzing the validity and public opinion of news articles
                    as they relate to the 2020 election.

        <h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>
        <h5>College</h5>
        <h6>Spring 2020</h6>
        <p>
            During this time, I served as a <strong style="color:darkcyan;">Course Assistant</strong> for <a href="https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu" target="_blank">CS 125</a>. 
            CS 125 provides an introduction to Java and Object Oriented Programming, and I contributed by holding office hours and teaching a labratory session each week.
            I also serve on Course Staff for <a href="http://cs196.cs.illinois.edu" target="_blank">CS 196</a> as a <strong style="color:darkcyan;">Project Manager</strong>. 
            CS 196 is the Honors Computer Science class for freshman
            in which students build a semester long project. This semester, my team built a webapp called <a href="https://cs196illinois.github.io/MyNavigate/" target="_blank">MyNavigate</a> 
            that allows a user to navigate around areas of high crime.
        </p>
        <h6>Fall 2019</h6>
        <p>
            My first semester of college, I got involved in activities like Engineering Council as the <strong style="color:darkcyan;">Activities Director</strong> on the <a href="https://site.ec.illinois.edu" target="_blank">SITE</a> Committee.
            SITE is a multi-day program meant to introduce over 100 admitted engineering students to Engineering @ Illinois. I contributed by designing the 
            orientation schedule. I also enjoyed being involved with Indian Student Association and attending sporting events on campus.

        <h5>High School</h5>
        <p>I graduated from Plainfield North High School in 2019.</p>

        <h3><strong>Summer</strong></h3>
        <h5>2020</h5>
        <p>
            This summer I interned as a software developer at <a href="https://digitalforces.com/index.html" target="_blank">Digital Forces</a>,
            where I wrote code, performed statistical modelling and analysis, monitoring, and 
           suggested physical and configuration changes in order to improve current license plate recognition systems. Also, I implemented accurate automatic 
           license plate recognition software utilizing multilayered neural networks to automate the asphalt loading process.
           Over the summer, I gained experience with languages and 
           technologies such as C# and .NET while also learning first-hand
           how tech companies functioned. Alongside this full time internship, I took summer classes like Physics and Linear Algebra.

        <h3><strong>Interests</strong></h3>
        <p> I've played basketball since fifth grade, tennis since eighth grade, and recently began running at the end of my senior year.
            I enjoy going to the gym to box, swim, do pilates, and lift.
            In 2019, I ran the Naperville Women's Half Marathon and hope to participate in more races in the future!
            I also enjoy eating and cooking food, visiting new places, and playing and listening to music.
