        <h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>
        <h5>College</h5>
        <h6>Fall 2021</h6>
        <p>
            In Fall 2021, I was a <strong style="color:darkcyan;">Course Associate</strong> for the revamped <a href="https://www.cs124.org/" target="_blank">CS 124</a>. 
            I also continued on the SITE committee for Engineering Council, this time as the Banquets chair. I also am taking responsibility as the Marketing Chair for Pulse 2022!
            This year, I was a Liasion for a dance competition called Udaan!
        </p>
        <h6>Spring 2021</h6>
        <p>
            In Spring 2021, I was excited to be a <strong style="color:darkcyan;">Course Associate</strong> for the pilot semester of CS 128, which is 
            an introduction to C++ and software design! I worked on creating content for the class as well as hosting a laboratory section!
        </p>
        <h6>Fall 2020</h6>
        <p>
            This semester, I was a <strong style="color:darkcyan;">Course Associate</strong> for CS 125. I also continued as a <strong style="color:darkcyan;">Project Manager</strong> for CS 196, but this semester
            I was in charge of two teams! Both teams, coincidentally, worked on projects that related to the Presidential Election.
        </p>
        <h6>Spring 2020</h6>
        <p>
            During this time, I served as a <strong style="color:darkcyan;">Course Assistant</strong> for <a href="https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu" target="_blank">CS 125</a>. 
            CS 125 provides an introduction to Java and Object Oriented Programming, and I contributed by holding office hours and teaching a labratory session each week.
            I also serve on Course Staff for <a href="http://cs196.cs.illinois.edu" target="_blank">CS 196</a> as a <strong style="color:darkcyan;">Project Manager</strong>. 
            CS 196 is the Honors Computer Science class for freshmen.
            in which students build a semester long project. This semester, my team built a webapp called <a href="https://cs196illinois.github.io/MyNavigate/" target="_blank">MyNavigate</a> 
            that allows a user to navigate around areas of high crime.
        </p>
        <h6>Fall 2019</h6>
        <p>
            My first semester of college, I got involved in activities like Engineering Council as the <strong style="color:darkcyan;">Activities Director</strong> on the <a href="https://site.ec.illinois.edu" target="_blank">SITE</a> Committee.
            SITE is a multi-day program meant to introduce over 100 admitted engineering students to Engineering @ Illinois. I contributed by designing the 
            orientation schedule. I also enjoyed being involved with Indian Student Association and attending sporting events on campus.

        <h3><strong>Summer</strong></h3>
        <h5>2022</h5>
        <p>
            This summer, I joined <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Squarespace</a>  as a Software Engineering Intern on the EPA team!
            During my 12 weeks, I worked on adding a major feature for the team, participating in code reviews and team discussions, and bonded with my cohort of interns through programming around NYC.
       </p>
        <h5>2021</h5>
        <p>
            This summer I interned as a Software Development Intern at <a href="https://www.williamblair.com/" target="_blank">William Blair</a> in Chicago,
            where I worked on the Enterprise Architecture team on a project called PowerBI Stats. This project allowed me to get an introduction to data 
            and engage with stakeholders while I managed the project from start to finish. The project entailed of building a enterprise reporting platform for
             PowerBI Dashboards utilizing advanced querying and aggregating that simplifies tenants to enhances Investment Banking and Private Wealth Management efficiency.
            I did this by implementing automated software in an Agile environment using C# and a SQL Server that maintains real-time data accuracy, consistency, and security
             of PowerBI assets firmwide. Alongside this full time internship, I took summer classes in Physics (Electricity and Magnetism).
       </p>
        <h5>2020</h5>
        <p>
            This summer I interned as a Software Development Intern at <a href="https://digitalforces.com/index.html" target="_blank">Digital Forces</a>,
            where I wrote code, performed statistical modelling and analysis, monitoring, and 
           suggested physical and configuration changes in order to improve current license plate recognition systems. Also, I implemented accurate automatic 
           license plate recognition software utilizing multilayered neural networks to automate the asphalt loading process.
           Over the summer, I gained experience with languages and 
           technologies such as C# and .NET while also learning first-hand
           how tech companies functioned. Alongside this full time internship, I took a summer class in Physics (Mechanics).
